brief: |
  Teach First wanted two videos for a joint editorial campaign with Trinity Mirror to encourage young people to train as teachers.

  The charity challenges educational inequality by recruiting bright graduates to work in the most deprived schools. These are all around the country, so it works with Trinity Mirror’s local titles, such as the Liverpool Echo, Nottingham Post and Birmingham Mail, to recruit for those areas.

  The videos needed to convey two messages: that teaching is a demanding and rewarding profession; and that it can change people’s lives for the better. They needed to work on the title’s websites and social media accounts – particularly Facebook – as well as the charity’s own channels. And they needed to appeal to undergraduates and recent graduates and inspire social sharing.

      Communication is often most effective via humour or emotion. Happen used both
      to get the messages across. The first video was based on the fact that teachers
      are asked dozens of questions each hour. So it asked the viewer whether he or
      she would be able to answer children’s toughest questions in a fun Buzzfeed-style
      format. The second was a more traditional case study. It told the story of how
      a teacher helped a troubled, disruptive pupil turn her life around and win a place
      at Oxford University in an engaging, emotional way.

      Getting the best out of children on camera requires a relaxed shoot and a
      lot of patience. We spent a day filming with the pupils of Reach Academy in Feltham,
      asking a lot of open-ending questions to make sure we had enough good answers
      to make a funny and powerful film. We used a bright yellow background, so the
      video would stand out on Facebook. We edited the footage to make viewers imagine
      themselves as teachers – and cut in a series of chapter headings to ask whether
      they could cope in the classroom.

      The second video was about a young woman and her former teacher. As an immigrant, the young woman struggled to learn English and understand what was going on in the classroom. Insecure and frustrated, she was violent and
      disruptive, and often excluded from school as a result. But over time, her teacher
      made her realise her potential and become an A-grade student. Key to the video
      was the interviews with both teacher and student. These covered her angry behaviour, the
      support she received and how she won a place at Oxford University. We then cut
      the interviews with illustrations of the student kicking off in the classroom, footage
      of her at Oxford and shots of the teacher in the classroom. But most importantly, we
      showed how the teacher’s help made the student feel, and how her success made him feel. This
      gave the video a genuine emotional power.

  The two films worked extremely well across Trinity Mirror’s titles and also proved popular on the social accounts of Teach First. Teach First was so pleased with the figures that it plans to put spend behind the videos when it starts to push teacher recruitment again.
