brief: "Under attack from a new competitor, Zoopla wanted to make sure its existing
  and potential clients fully understood the benefits of its services.\n\nIt had lost
  23% of its customers to OnTheMarket, which was offering estate and letting agents
  preferential deals if they signed exclusively with it and __only one other__ property
  portal.\n\nAs the number two in the market – behind RightMove – Zoopla was hardest
  hit by this tactic. It responded by re-examining its B2B marketing, and as a result
  commissioned Happen to develop and produce a series of video animation explainers,
  with the aim of convincing agents to stick with or switch to Zoopla. "

outputs:
- body: 'In consultation with the Zoopla team, Happen developed a look (including
    a cast of characters) and format for the animations. These explained how Zoopla’s
    key digital products worked and showed their impact on customers’ businesses.
    We have now made explainers for almost all of Zoopla’s products: from its remarketing
    service AdReach, to Property File, its app for tenants, vendors and agents. Our
    animations are distributed via traditional digital channels and also used in presentations
    by Zoopla’s 100+ strong sales team.'

- body: Happen also helped Zoopla overhaul the content section, Extra, of its ZooplaPro
    portal for agents. We assisted with its redesign and drew up a content plan with
    its B2B marketing team. We also worked with them to develop and produce a series
    of short thought leadership video interviews with Zoopla senior staff. These provided
    actionable advice for agents about how to make their businesses more effective
    online.

- body: 'We have also worked closely with Zoopla to explain the strategy behind its
    acquisition of the price comparison website uSwitch and the Property Software
    Group, which provides cloud and desktop services for estate agents. The strategy
    has allowed it to offer more services and, by integrating their platforms, new
    ways for agents to serve their customers and make money. We have produced content
    explaining this ‘market, manage and maximise’ strategy aimed at its customers
    and investors. '

- body: Happen has also worked with Zoopla’s B2C team. We made a video about its Running
    Costs tool with TV property expert Phil Spencer, and have recently produced a
    series of video guides with him to promote Zoopla’s new Move service to homemovers.
    Move guides people through the moving process, helping them prioritise jobs, find
    vetted moving services and save time and money. The series features advice for
    buyers and sellers and formats created for Facebook and Instagram.
