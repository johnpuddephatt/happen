description: We helped zoopla property group explain their services
brief: "Under attack from a new competitor, Zoopla wanted to make sure its existing
  and potential clients fully understood the benefits of its services.\n\nIt had lost
  nearly a quarter of its customers\tto OnTheMarket, which was offering estate and
  letting agents preferential deals if they signed exclusively with it and only one
  other property portal. As the number two in the market - behind RightMove - Zoopla
  was hardest hit by this tactic.\n\nIt responded by re-examining its B2B marketing,
  and commissioned Happen to develop and produce a series of video animation explainers,
  with the aim of convincing agents to stick with or switch to Zoopla.\n"

  These new videos and animations have helped us win new customers and convince existing ones to use more of our services. We couldn’t be happier.

results: |
  Since Happen has started working with Zoopla, the company has shrugged off OnTheMarket’s challenge, winning back approximately 600 estate agents as of November last year. Its last full-year results saw its revenue rising from property services by 9%, to £87m. Over the year to September last year it had 927,000 properties listed on its site - up almost 10% year on year - from more than 23,000 estate agents and other customers.

  - Won back **600** estate agents
  - Revenue up by 9% to **£87M**
  - Properties up **10%** to £927,000
outputs:
- heading: Animations that explain
  body: 'In consultation with the Zoopla team, Happen developed a look (including
    a cast of characters) and format for the animations. These explained how Zoopla’s
    key digital products worked and showed their impact on customers’ businesses.
    We have now made explainers for almost all of Zoopla’s products: from its remarketing
    service AdReach, to Property File, its app for tenants, vendors and agents. Our
    animations are distributed via traditional digital channels and also used in presentations
    by Zoopla’s 100+ strong sales team.'

- heading: Video interviews
  body: Happen also helped Zoopla overhaul the content section, Extra, of its ZooplaPro
    portal for agents. We assisted with its redesign and drew up a content plan with
    its B2B marketing team. We also worked with them to develop and produce a series
    of short thought leadership video interviews with Zoopla senior staff. These provided
    actionable advice for agents about how to make their businesses more effective
    online.

- heading: Communicating new services
  body: Happen has also worked closely with Zoopla to explain the strategy behind
    its acquisition of the price comparison website uSwitch and the Property Software
    Group, which provides cloud and desktop services for estate agents. This has allowed
    it to offer more services and, by integrating their platforms, new ways for agents
    to serve their customers and make money. We have produced content explaining this
    ‘market, manage and maximise’ strategy aimed at its customers and investors.

- heading: Video guides with Phil Spencer
  body: Happen has also worked with Zoopla’s B2C team. We made a video about its Running
    Costs tool with TV property expert Phil Spencer, and have recently produced a
    series of video guides with him to promote Zoopla’s new Move service to homemovers.
    Move guides people through the moving process, helping them prioritise jobs, find
    vetted moving services and save time and money. The series features advice for
    buyers and sellers and formats created for Facebook and Instagram.
