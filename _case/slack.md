description: We helped Slack explain the difference they make to their customers
brief: |
  Slack’s communication tool is designed to help companies reduce internal emails and meetings, improving productivity, transparency, and widening the sharing of information and knowledge.

  Slack wanted to commission two video case studies to show how its software transforms organisations; with the UK its second biggest market, it asked Happen to help.
results: |
  Both of the films were watchable and short - clocking in at round 90 seconds. They now feature on Slack’s customer stories page and YouTube channel, as well as being used by its sales team.   

outputs:
- heading: "Choosing the right direction"
  body: "Communication is often most effective via humour or emotion. Happen used both to get the messages across. The first video was based on the fact that teachers are asked dozens of questions each hour. So it asked the viewer whether he or she would be able to answer children’s toughest questions in a fun Buzzfeed-style format. The second was a more traditional case study. It told the story of how a teacher helped a troubled, disruptive pupil turn her life around and win a place at Oxford University in an engaging, emotional way."

- heading: "Using humour"
  body: "Getting the best out of children on camera requires a relaxed shoot and a lot of patience. We spent a day filming with the pupils of Reach Academy in Feltham, asking a lot of open-ending questions to make sure we had enough good answers to make a funny and powerful film. We used a bright yellow background, so the video would stand out on Facebook. We edited the footage to make viewers imagine themselves as teachers – and cut in a series of chapter headings to ask whether they could cope in the classroom."

- heading: "Creating an emotional response"
  body: "The second video was about a young woman, Sara Harb, and her former teacher Liam McGillicuddy. As an immigrant, Sara struggled to learn English and understand what was going on in the classroom. Insecure and frustrated, she was violent and disruptive, and often excluded from school as a result. But over time, her teacher made her realise her potential and become an A-grade student. Key to the video was the interviews with Sara and Liam. These covered her angry behaviour, the support she received and how she won a place at Oxford University. We then cut the interviews with illustrations of Sara kicking off in the classroom, footage of her at Oxford and shots of Liam in the classroom. But most importantly, we showed how Liam’s help made Sara feel, and how her success made him feel. This gave the video a genuine emotional power."
