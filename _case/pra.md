description: We helped Prison Radio Association keep people from reoffending
brief: |
  The Prison Radio Association wanted to make a series of short films for a smartphone app aimed at people leaving prison, with the aim of helping them stay out of jail. The idea was to provide advice and inspiration during for people during their first week out of prison.

  The Prison Radio Association also wanted the process to be transformative: equipping it to produce video as well as audio, and turning it into a truly multimedia organisation. It turned to Happen to executive produce the series while also training one of its radio producers to plan, shoot and edit the seven films.

  Elliot is extremely friendly, knowledgeable and approachable. He helped us focus on our priorities and offered great advice at every stage of the production process. He’s given a lot of energy and passion to our project.
