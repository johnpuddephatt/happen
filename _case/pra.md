brief: "The Prison Radio Association wanted to make a series of short films for a
  smartphone app aimed at people leaving prison, with the aim of helping them stay
  out of jail. The idea was to provide advice and inspiration during for people during
  their first week out of prison.\n\nThe Prison Radio Association also wanted the
  process to be transformative: equipping it to produce video as well as audio, and
  turning it into a truly multimedia organisation. It turned to Happen to executive
  produce the series while also training one of its radio producers to plan, shoot
  and edit the seven films.  \n"

- body: 'Happen worked with the Prison Radio Association team throughout pre-production,
    production and post-production. We advised on equipment and format, recommending
    a simple shooting style suitable for someone new to filmmaking, that would result
    in an effective video with high production values. We also helped cast the films,
    identifying who would best communicate the project’s key messages. '

- body: We devised a training programme and filming schedule that enabled the Prison
    Radio Association producer to acquire new skills and grow in confidence throughout
    the production process. Our head of video, Elliot Smith, was present during all
    the filming days, providing practical support and editorial guidance. He also
    oversaw post-production, making sure the finished films were suitable for an app
    experience.
