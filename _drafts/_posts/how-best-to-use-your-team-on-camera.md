We’ve made quite a few films recently featuring our clients. It can be very effective but also challenging and it might not be right for every video. Here then is what you should keep in mind when considering putting your staff front of camera.

There are good reasons to use professional presenters, actors and voiceover artists. They’re usually professionals because they’re good at their jobs. A good voiceover artist will deliver an expressive and lively ‘read’ of a script, which will lift a film or animation. Using your staff will be cheaper, but it should also ideally contribute something else to the film.

We’ve recently made a number of videos featuring the team at Octopus Energy. It’s a startup challenging the ‘big six’ energy suppliers by offering better customer service and lower prices for new and existing customers – the ‘big six’ typically charge much more to long-term customers than new ones. So why have we used its team on camera?

Firstly, to create trust. It is a big decision to switch energy supplier, particularly to a startup you may never have heard of before. People tend to trust people they feel they’ve met. That is why most crowdfunding videos start and end with a ‘piece-to-camera’ by the founder of the business.

Secondly, to show what it stands for. Octopus’s founder, Greg Jackson, is genuinely passionate about changing the energy market by giving people a better deal and making it more sustainable. He’s therefore a fantastic frontman for his company. Likewise his young team, who are articulate, intelligent and committed.

We’ve also recently made a film for the City of London Sinfonia about how it is different to other orchestras …

Finally, to provide its expertise. Who better to explain how to switch than the people who’ll help you switch? We’ve therefore made a series of FAQ videos with Octopus’s energy specialists. We’ve also made more ‘thought leadership’ films with its data scientist, David Sykes, about the iniquities of the energy market and how a variable price cap would improve it.

So how best to use your team on camera? First, take care with casting.  Don’t always assume your CEO should present everything. They might be the right person, but sometimes they won’t be. Think about who is best to represent your organisation in this particular film and who knows most about the subject at hand. Think too about who might actually be good on camera.

People you think will be good on camera usually are, but it is definitely worth your while giving a few of your team a screen test. That only need involve filming them explaining something to camera. If someone doesn’t want to be filmed, that usually means they won’t be good, as they’re already convinced of that.

Talking directly to a camera can be surprisingly difficult – it can feel weird talking to an inanimate object. Another technique is to film your staff being interviewed, which is a much more natural experience. We did that with three members of the City of London Sinfonia for a film recently and edited the interviews with footage of them performing. They were great on camera: articulate and passionate about why the orchestra is different.

Before filming don’t tell people to relax, it has a similar effect as telling an angry person not to shout. Also allow people to speak in their own words. If there’s a script, allow them to adapt it into their own words – that is what TV news presenters do. And think of ways to help people remember what they’re meant to be saying – we used printed cards in some FAQ videos we made for Octopus, which was simple but effective.
