Instructional videos are a big deal – arguably one of the most useful ways in which video on the web has evolved. Need to [tie a bow tie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxKA9be_3Gk)? [Rewire a plug](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID26I5ZeWh8)? [Cook Yorkshire puddings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGGP2jmR-fc)? Chances are you can find a video to show you what to do.

Quality control however is non-existent, and although you might find a polished video that’s fun to watch and features an articulate presenter, you’re just as likely to end up watching a blurry video shot on someone’s phone that jumps about and features heavy breathing and unclear narration.

[Yodomo](https://yodomo.co) is a startup that wants to change all that, working with creators and artists to develop a range of how-to video series that are beautiful as well as practical.

Yodomo approached Happen when they had the opportunity of filming a series of videos with the brilliant cook and food writer [Sabrina Ghayour](http://www.sabrinaghayour.com). The brief was to record some friendly advice on entertaining with food as well as demonstrate some recipes from Sabrina’s new book Feasts.

Over two days we shot material for a course of ten videos, culminating in the creation of three delicious recipes: Beer roasted pork, Burrata with pomegranate seeds and Fig and Honey Millefeuille.

On set with us were stylist [Kathrin McCrea](https://www.kathrinmccreaphotography.co.uk) and home economist [Udo Reicheltschaurer](https://udoreicheltschaurer.com) as well as the star of the show, [Sabrina herself](https://www.instagram.com/sabrinaghayour/?hl=en "Sabrina's Instagram").

Two days was an ambitious schedule and so we shot all the recipes on two cameras to give us options in the edit – ideally it would have been nice to have another angle as well. You can never have too much coverage when you’re trying to capture a process like following a recipe.

We’re all so used to watching cookery programmes on TV where the food is the real star of the show – and the challenge on this job was trying to make the most of Sabrina’s delicious recipes on a relatively modest budget. With careful lighting and a good relationship with both the client and the talent, we were able to help Yodomo create a Feast of a video series, and one that we’re all very proud of.
