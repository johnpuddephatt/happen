If you watched the first virtual Prime Minister’s Question Time yesterday, you’ll have noticed that lots of MPs haven’t mastered how to look good on Zoom. At least none was caught swearing about a colleague – as a member of the Welsh Assembly [was](https://order-order.com/2020/04/22/watch-welsh-health-ministers-f-word-facetime-faux-pas/) - but there was still definitely room for improvement.

As a creative video agency, we’ve been asked by a lot of our clients for a simple, illustrated guide to looking great on Zoom. It isn’t difficult: a laptop, quiet space, pile of books and window is all you need. So here is a guide for you, your colleagues and team. We hope it is helpful.
