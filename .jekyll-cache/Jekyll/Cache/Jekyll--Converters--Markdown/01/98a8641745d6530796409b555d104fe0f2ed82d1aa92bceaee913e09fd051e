I"~<p>Instructional videos are a big deal – arguably one of the most useful ways in which video on the web has evolved. Need to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxKA9be_3Gk">tie a bow tie</a>? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID26I5ZeWh8">Rewire a plug</a>? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGGP2jmR-fc">Cook Yorkshire puddings</a>? Chances are you can find a video to show you what to do.</p>

<p>Quality control however is non-existent, and although you might find a polished video that’s fun to watch and features an articulate presenter, you’re just as likely to end up watching a blurry video shot on someone’s phone that jumps about and features heavy breathing and unclear narration.</p>

<p><a href="https://yodomo.co">Yodomo</a> is a startup that wants to change all that, working with creators and artists to develop a range of how-to video series that are beautiful as well as practical.</p>

<p>Yodomo approached Happen when they had the opportunity of filming a series of videos with the brilliant cook and food writer <a href="http://www.sabrinaghayour.com">Sabrina Ghayour</a>. The brief was to record some friendly advice on entertaining with food as well as demonstrate some recipes from Sabrina’s new book Feasts.</p>

<p>Over two days we shot material for a course of ten videos, culminating in the creation of three delicious recipes: Beer roasted pork, Burrata with pomegranate seeds and Fig and Honey Millefeuille.</p>

<p>On set with us were Yodomo founder Sophie Rochester (seen below with the finished feast), stylist <a href="https://www.kathrinmccreaphotography.co.uk">Kathrin McCrea</a> and home economist <a href="https://udoreicheltschaurer.com">Udo Reicheltschaurer</a> as well as the star of the show, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sabrinaghayour/?hl=en" title="Sabrina's Instagram">Sabrina herself</a>.</p>

<p>Two days was an ambitious schedule and so we shot all the recipes on two cameras to give us options in the edit – ideally it would have been nice to have another angle as well. You can never have too much coverage when you’re trying to capture a process like following a recipe.</p>

<p>We’re all so used to watching cookery programmes on TV where the food is the real star of the show – and the challenge on this job was trying to make the most of Sabrina’s delicious recipes on a relatively modest budget. With careful lighting and a good relationship with both the client and the talent, we were able to help Yodomo create a Feast of a video series, and one that we’re all very proud of.</p>
