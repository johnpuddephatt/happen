I"	<p>Content marketing is as important for B2B companies as B2C ones, if not more so. B2B buyers are much more rigorous in their decision-making than the typical consumer. They want to be certain that what they’re buying will do the job and give them maximum return on their investment. This is particularly true for the technology sector where goods and services are by their nature complex.</p>

<p>Despite this, we’re often surprised by how B2B technology companies struggle with content marketing. Content is produced without a clear understanding of where it fits in the bigger picture. It is also often uninspired, uninteresting and unlikely to persuade anyone of anything.</p>

<p>To set you on the right path, we’ve created this practical guide to help you maximize the return from your firm’s investment in content. It is based on our experience helping big names like Zoopla, Slack and Auto Trader and as journalists – we worked at the BBC, Channel 4 and the Guardian.</p>

<p>We find most companies prefer to produce written content in-house and video out-of-house, so it focuses on how to develop and implement a content strategy and commission key video formats.</p>

<p>We hope you find the guide helpful.</p>
