I"c<p>We believe that case study films are one of the most effective ways to show potential customers the benefits of a company’s products and services. They play a vital role in the customer journey: providing the reassurance people need ahead of a purchase. People trust people without a vested interest to recommend things, as the popularity of TripAdvisor and Trustpilot prove. So a video featuring an effusive client is very persuasive.
We focused on two companies: Ocado Technology, which develops the software and systems that power the online grocery retail platforms of Ocado and Morrisons, and Marks &amp; Spencer. One is the sort of technology company that Slack’s initial growth has been driven by. The other is a long-established, iconic brand that is seeking to transform the way it works and its customer experience, both online and in its shops.</p>
