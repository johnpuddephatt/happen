I"<p>In consultation with the Zoopla team, Happen developed a look (including a cast of characters) and format for the animations. These explained how Zoopla’s key digital products worked and showed their impact on customers’ businesses. We have now made explainers for almost all of Zoopla’s products: from its remarketing service AdReach, to Property File, its app for tenants, vendors and agents. Our animations are distributed via traditional digital channels and also used in presentations by Zoopla’s 100+ strong sales team.</p>
