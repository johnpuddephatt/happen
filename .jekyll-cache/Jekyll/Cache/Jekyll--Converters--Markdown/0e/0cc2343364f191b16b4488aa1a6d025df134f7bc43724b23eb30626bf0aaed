I"O<p>The second video was about a young woman, Sara Harb, and her former teacher Liam McGillicuddy. As an immigrant, Sara struggled to learn English and understand what was going on in the classroom. Insecure and frustrated, she was violent and disruptive, and often excluded from school as a result. But over time, her teacher made her realise her potential and become an A-grade student. Key to the video was the interviews with Sara and Liam. These covered her angry behaviour, the support she received and how she won a place at Oxford University. We then cut the interviews with illustrations of Sara kicking off in the classroom, footage of her at Oxford and shots of Liam in the classroom. But most importantly, we showed how Liamâ€™s help made Sara feel, and how her success made him feel. This gave the video a genuine emotional power.</p>
