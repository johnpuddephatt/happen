I"©<p>Under attack from a new competitor, Zoopla wanted to make sure its existing and potential clients fully understood the benefits of its services.</p>

<p>It had lost 23% of its customers to OnTheMarket, which was offering estate and letting agents preferential deals if they signed exclusively with it and <strong>only one other</strong> property portal.</p>

<p>As the number two in the market â€“ behind RightMove â€“ Zoopla was hardest hit by this tactic. It responded by re-examining its B2B marketing, and as a result commissioned Happen to develop and produce a series of video animation explainers, with the aim of convincing agents to stick with or switch to Zoopla.</p>
