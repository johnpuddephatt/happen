I"ë<p>If you watched the first virtual Prime Ministerâ€™s Question Time yesterday, youâ€™ll have noticed that lots of MPs havenâ€™t mastered how to look good on Zoom. At least none was caught swearing about a colleague â€“ <a href="https://order-order.com/2020/04/22/watch-welsh-health-ministers-f-word-facetime-faux-pas/">as a member of the Welsh Assembly was</a> - but there was still definitely room for improvement.</p>

<p>As a creative video agency, weâ€™ve been asked by a lot of our clients for a simple, illustrated guide to looking great on Zoom. It isnâ€™t difficult: a laptop, quiet space, pile of books and window is all you need.</p>

<p><strong>The problem</strong></p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2020/04/24/bad video.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>A lot of people on Zoom look this. The laptop is on a desk, making the camera angle unflattering. The background is cluttered. The eyeline looks awkward because the subject isnâ€™t looking directly at the camera. Thereâ€™s a light source in the background. The viewer is distracted by the poor framing.</p>

<p><strong>The solution</strong></p>

<p>The face is evenly lit because the subject is facing a window. The angle is more flattering because the laptop has been raised to eye level. The eyeline is much better because the subject is looking straight at the camera, about 1/3 of the way down the frame. Thereâ€™s no light source behind the subject confusing the camera. The background is still a bit busy but now provides context because itâ€™s clearly visible.</p>

<p><strong>Two minutes to a better picture</strong></p>

<p>Transform the picture by doing three things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Turn towards the light. This makes sure your face is illuminated.</li>
  <li>Raise the laptop off the surface of the desk (here, by using two shoeboxes). This improves the camera angle.</li>
  <li>Make sure the subjectâ€™s eyeline is about 1/3 of the way down the frame.</li>
</ol>
