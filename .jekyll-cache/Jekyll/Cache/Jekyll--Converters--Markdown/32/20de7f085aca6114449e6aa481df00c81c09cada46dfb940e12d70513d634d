I"<p>Each film focused on the big picture impact Slack made on the companies, digging deeper than just its convenience and advantages over email. They featured interviewees from across the businesses: senior managers to explain how Slack fitted into their overall strategies, and middle managers and staff to talk about the practical differences it has made to their day-to-day work.
We made sure each included specific examples. For example, the M&amp;S film featured an interviewee describing how she used Slack to sort out a software problem she saw when she was out of the office visiting an M&amp;S call centres. She was able to report it back to her team, take and send a photo, and get it fixed while she was there. Her anecdote showed exactly how Slack made M&amp;S more agile.</p>
