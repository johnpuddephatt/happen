I"<p>Getting the best out of children on camera requires a relaxed shoot and a lot of patience. We spent a day filming with the pupils of Reach Academy in Feltham, asking a lot of open-ending questions to make sure we had enough good answers to make a funny and powerful film. We used a bright yellow background, so the video would stand out on Facebook. We edited the footage to make viewers imagine themselves as teachers â€“ and cut in a series of chapter headings to ask whether they could cope in the classroom.</p>
