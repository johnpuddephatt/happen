I"­<p>Hack days are a great way to unleash your teamâ€™s creativity, bring people together and generate new products and services. They are usually one or two-day events where developers, designers and other come together to build new things. They are often competitive, with prizes for the best ideas. The more diverse the hack teams, the more interesting the hacks. That is why people often invite teams from other companies.</p>
